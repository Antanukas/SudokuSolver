SudokuSolver - python program for fast sudoku solving.

NOTE:
	Current version of SudokuSolver works only on linux.
	In near future I'll upgrade it to work platform independent.

INSTRUCTIONS:
	* Preparation:
		To use this program at first you have to install sudoku module.
		Do it in terminal:
			cd path_to_dir_/SudokuSolver/Sudoku
			python setup.py sdist (if you use python 3 or greater: python3 setup.py sdist)
			python setup.py install (if you use python 3 or greater: python3 setup.py install)
		After Sudoku module installation you can run program.
	
	* Program running:
		From command line:
			cd path_to_dir_/SudokuSolver
			python SudokuSolver.py
		After that program takes data from sudoku.txt and puts answer in answer.txt (if sudoku.txt doesn't exist you'll get an error)
		You can use flags to change source and destination of the data (look at "Sudoku data").
		Type in command line
			python SudokuSolver.py -help 
		to find out more about this.
		
	* Sudoku data
		1) You can put sudoku matrix to file, by default it is sudoku.txt, 
			but you can change it. 
			First line in the input file must be empty or with comments (no sudoku data)
			Then you can enter sudoku data. 
			IMPORTANT: Empty squares must be filled with zeros.
			To use this method enter flag -f or -d
			For example:
				python SudokuSolver.py -c [filename1] [filename2] (to take data from filename1 file and put answer in filename2 file, if no filenames entered then program uses default values in file - sudoku.txt, out file - answer.txt)
				python SudokuSolver.py -d [filename] (to take data from file filename and display answer in console. If no filename entered the program uses default value sudoku.txt)
				
		2) You can enter sudoku matrix in SudokuSolver.py file, in the begining of the file is
			const named SUDOKU. Enter sudoku matrix with the same rules as in file. 
			To use this method enter flag -c or -e
			For example:
				python SudokuSolver.py -c [filename] (to put answer in file, if no filename entered will put in sudoku.txt file)
				python SudokuSolver.py -e  (to display answer in console)
